            <h2>Project Summary: </h2>
            My final project is going to be based on my Every Picture Project. The subject of this project is feminism. I will be displaying quotes and information about feminists from around the world.

            Comparison Project 1:
          </h2>
          <p> The first website I chose, by “Stylist”, is a page that displays 50 quotes of different feminists. It also includes their names and a portrait  of them.  I like the introduction at the top of the page. It gives a brief  but interesting overview of what the rest of the page will display. Something I noticed when going through the website was that the images were irrationally large so It was often distracting when trying to read the quote by each woman. I found myself scrolling through the images instead of reading the quotes as it seemed as though the main focus of this page was on the portraits. not the quotes.

          <h2>Comparison Project 2 :</h2>
          <p>The second website I chose, by “Parade”, is very similar to the first website as it also displays several feminist quotes but takes a very different stylistic approach. I think the introduction is very powerful and a great opening to the rest of the page. I like that a lot of the quotes are just displayed one after another, in a simple yet elegant manner.  However, I found part of the layout to be very awkward. Some of the quotes have an image underneath while most do not. I wasn’t able to find a pattern that explained the reasoning behind this so it left me confused about the difference in layout. </p>

        <h2>Project Goals: </h2>
        <p>
            
            The goal of my project is to display quotes of feminists from through the world. I want to inform the user of these political figures and give the user background about the figures.

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>
           I plan to display the information in a “row-like” format. I will have a row that displays the quote and portrait for each woman from a particular continent. I will also include a flag and the name of the country at the top of each row. I plan to put the portrait on one side of the page and the quote on the other side. I hope that this emphasizes equal importance on the two elements. 
        </p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            I plan to include overlays so that when the user clicks on the image or quote, an overlay will display with background information about the feminist. 
        </p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I hope that user is motivated to continue reading about each of the feminists and that I am able to achieve a beautiful, empathetic user experience throughout the page. I plan to do this through a clean, simple layout. I hope that the overlays will make the page less overwhelming by letting the user make an informed decision about whether they want more information on a particular woman.
