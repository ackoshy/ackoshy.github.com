            <h2>User Tester 1: </h2>
            My first user tester was Divya Nair. Divya made the observation that it was hard to know whether the answer choices were clickable and whether the answer had been clicked or not. Since the mouse did not change to a hand when the user hovered over the choices, the user was not sure if the choice was clickable or not despite the hover effect. Additionally, even when the user clicked their answer, there was no way of knowing that the click had been processed because the screen stayed stagnant with no indication. For my final project, I plan to manually change the mouse icon into a hand when the user hovers over an answer choice. Additionally, I want to implement a scroll effect so that when the click registers, the screen will automatically take the user to the next question.

          <h2>
            Comparison Project 1:
          </h2>
          <p> The first website I chose, by “Stylist”, is a page that displays 50 quotes of different feminists. It also includes their names and a portrait  of them.  I like the introduction at the top of the page. It gives a brief  but interesting overview of what the rest of the page will display. Something I noticed when going through the website was that the images were irrationally large so It was often distracting when trying to read the quote by each woman. I found myself scrolling through the images instead of reading the quotes as it seemed as though the main focus of this page was on the portraits. not the quotes.

          <h2>User Tester 2 :</h2>
          <p>My second user tester was Annette. One main observation that Annette made had to do with the navigation bar. I had a navigation bar at the top just to give it the  “buzzed feel.” I wanted the page to feel like a real website so I added the navigation bar at the top of the page. However, the navigation bar does not add any real value from a functionality point of view. The navigation bar was simply a bar of broken links which was confusing to the user. Usually, a navigation bar contains links to a separate page so when Annette clicked on the links it was confusing that nothing happened. I didn’t want the user to feel like they had done something wrong but I also did not want to create separate pages for each of the links. For my final project, I plan to add overlays with messages correlating to each of the links in the navigation bar. For example, “Shopping” will contain an overlay with some women-owned businesses to support.  </p>

          <h2>User Tester 3 :</h2>
          <p>
            My third and final user tester was Alexandria. Alexandria noticed the same issues as Divya and Annette such as the problem of clicking, knowing when to move to the next question, and the broken links in the navigation bar. One other thing that Alexandria mentioned was that the submit button was a little too small. For my final project, I would like to make the submit button larger or make it so that when the user answers the last question, the graphic of their “feminist icon” automatically appears.
