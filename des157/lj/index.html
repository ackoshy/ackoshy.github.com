        <h5>Game Design UX Best Practices</h5>
        <section>
            <p>In the article, “Game Design UX Practices, by Amir Dori, Dori talks about the best design practices to apply to the UI of  any game. Some things he talks about include sliders, pop-ups, and rewarded videos. Something I thought was interesting was that he mentions to avoid using the “X” on pop-ups. This is because users often associate the “X” with “annoying content” and are more likely to immediately close. Looking back, I realize that I too associate the “X” with “annoying content” because a lot of the times these pop-ups with an “X” are ads.  Realize that as a user, I myself would be very likely to close the pop-up as soon as I see the “X”. Dori also mentions some best practices such as using sliders so that the user does not have to exit the main page and to make use of rewarded videos. Overall, this article goes over the best practices of game design and has given me many ideas to think about when designing my “Game of Pig."</p>

        <h5>Visual Thinking Analysis</h5>

                <img src="march.JPG"  style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Annabel Koshy, 2021</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>The image I’m most excited about is a photo I took of my mom attending the 2017 women’s march. This picture means a lot to me because it was when I first became aware about the inequalities women face everyday.  This image really represents what the whole theme of my “Every Picture” project is revolved around. This image showcases a strong woman standing in front of a crowd holding up posters and chanting to promote feminism and reject the ridiculously misogynistic political figures at the time. At first glance, the image is obviously focused on the woman standing at the front but as you look more closely, you will see that the location is a protest. I believe some words that come to mind when analyzing this image are power, hope, fight, persistence, and passion. My collection for this project is a collection of feminist quotes that mean the most to me and ones that I think are particularly empowering. This collection represents my passion for equal rights, female empowerment, and how my mom has shaped me into the strong woman I am today. </p>

              </figure>
            <p>I believe that this image is a part of a computer. This image is particularly interesting because unless the user has sufficient knowledge in the hardware of the computer, at first glance, it is not easy to tell what the picture is about. However, as you look more closely, you see the different parts of the box-like object. I instantly noticed the miniature fan inside the black box and the metal-like objects which helped me come to the conclusion that it is a part of a computer. I think that the fact that the object is laying on a neutral-colored table without anything near it helps to bring out the focus of the object. My guess would be that this project has something to do with using computer parts to build a computer as a personal project or just about an interest in the hardware of a computer.  Overall, I think this is a great photo as the colors and placement of the object and surroundings help the audience focus on the analysis of the subject. </p>

        <h5>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h5>
        <section>
            <p>In the article, “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”, by Michael Gonchar, I learned about the several ways to engage a student about a topic and I realize that most of the process had to do with the way we analyze images. When looking for a website that exemplified an engaging user experience in regards to images, <a href="https://plantomax.pt/">PlantoMax</a> immediately stood out. 
                PlantoMax exemplifies amazing use of images as well as text. When you first get onto the website, the images and text quickly appear one by one on the page as separate elements. This only lasts for about a second so the user does not get bored or distract, but rather engages the user before they have even looked at the site. As the user scrolls, the elements pop up one by one, similar to how it did when the user first opens the site. I think this website is extremely effective, particularly because of its use of animations. The animations add a real value to the user experience because they allow for an engaging yet comprehensive experience. </p>

        <h5>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h5>
        <section>
            <p>In the article, “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows”,  by Naema Baskanderi, I learned about the pros and cons of using modals in a layout. I initially always thought of modals as a clever, efficient way to display information in a user-friendly manner. However, after reading this article, I do realize that although modals can be a great solution, but in some cases it can actually harm the usability of an interface. In order to create an efficient modal, I learned that there are some very specific details to account for. For example, Baskanderi emphasizes sizing and location as key to a good modal. Overall, I learned that although modals are not the best solution in all cases, they can be extremely effective when designed correctly.

        <h5>Best Practices for Form</h5>
        <section>
            <p>The article, "Best practices for form design", by Salim Ansari, Ansari goes over the details of how to create an efficient, user-friendly form. As I read through this article, I realized that there are so many aspects to UX in general,
                that we don’t directly recognize, but subconsciously lead to certain human behaviors. As I read about the “do’s and don'ts” of form design, I started to think about the different types of forms I have encountered and how I reacted
                to various layouts. I realized that I am particularly unlikely to complete a form that didn’t include a progress bar at the bottom as I can think of several instances where I have clicked the link to a form, but exited when I was not
                able to view the length of the questionnaire. I also started to think about times when I have created a form for other users. Usually, I create forms through google forms, and I recall adding the asterisk to indicate a question is
                required. I now realize that it would be better to not include the asterisk but rather, include a symbol indicating when a question is optional. A form that I recently interacted with that I thought was particularly good was actually
                the <a href="https://www.cvs.com/vaccine/intake/store/covid-screener/covid-qns">CVS</a> form I used to schedule my covid vaccination. The form had minimal questions, very few fields, and was overall very easy to navigate. If I had
                to add or change anything, I would add a progress bar at the end of the form. Overall, this article has taught me that small details in the way we ask or format a set of questions, can make a huge impact on human response.
