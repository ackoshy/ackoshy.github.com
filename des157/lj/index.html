        <h5>Best Practices for Form</h5>

            <p>The article, "Best practices for form design", by Salim Ansari, Ansari goes over the details of how to create an efficient, user-friendly form. As I read through this article, I realized that there are so many aspects to UX in general,
                that we don’t directly recognize, but subconsciously lead to certain human behaviors. As I read about the “do’s and don'ts” of form design, I started to think about the different types of forms I have encountered and how I reacted
                to various layouts. I realized that I am particularly unlikely to complete a form that didn’t include a progress bar at the bottom as I can think of several instances where I have clicked the link to a form, but exited when I was not
                able to view the length of the questionnaire. I also started to think about times when I have created a form for other users. Usually, I create forms through google forms, and I recall adding the asterisk to indicate a question is
                required. I now realize that it would be better to not include the asterisk but rather, include a symbol indicating when a question is optional. A form that I recently interacted with that I thought was particularly good was actually
                the <a href="https://www.cvs.com/vaccine/intake/store/covid-screener/covid-qns">CVS</a> form I used to schedule my covid vaccination. The form had minimal questions, very few fields, and was overall very easy to navigate. If I had
                to add or change anything, I would add a progress bar at the end of the form. Overall, this article has taught me that small details in the way we ask or format a set of questions, can make a huge impact on human response.
